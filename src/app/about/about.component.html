                was an aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised
                in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades
                as a
                scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
                and
                Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
                programme and
                military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work
                on
                the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
                organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
                since the
                original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata
                Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",
                he
                returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
                recipient

                an
                apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries
                attended the
                funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
