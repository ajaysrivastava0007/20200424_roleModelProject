                    Dr. Kalam was a Great Areospace Scientist and a wonderful Author.Kalam also served as President of
                    Indian Nation.

                <li>
                    After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee
                    working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to
                    the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first
                    Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth
                    orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at
                    DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to
                    include more engineers.

                    In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
                    Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
                    made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of
                    which proved to be successful.

                    Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
                    representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam
                    also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic
                    missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the
                    Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects
                    through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role
                    convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.
                    His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which
                    prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam
                    and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the
                    suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development
                    of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was
                    instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named
                    Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief
                    executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including
                    Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,
                    although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

                    Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests
                    were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role.
                    Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing
                    phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear
                    scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb
                    had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and
                    Chidambaram dismissed the claims.

                    In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
                    "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in
                    rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

                    Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                    presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi
                    Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.FF

                    On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed
                    that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and
                    the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its
                    support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.
                    Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:
                    <br>
                    <i><u>I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for
                            a
                            message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this
                            juncture.</u></i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and
                    his senior Cabinet colleagues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament and the state
                    assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was
                    a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam became the 11th president of the
                    Republic of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn
                    in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954)
                    and Dr Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the
                    President of India. He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati
                    Bhawan.

                    During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,
                    saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his
                    tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21
                    mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India
                    empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of
                    convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as
                    president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the
                    most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the
                    December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of
                    India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the
                    pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the
                    controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.
